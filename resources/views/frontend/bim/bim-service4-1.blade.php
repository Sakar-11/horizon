                        </h3>
                        <p>3D facility scanning technology and capabilities have continued to improve and evolve; Horizons brings our clients the best scanning hardware along with the knowledge to back it up.
                        </p>
                        <p>Leveraging FARA and Trimble technology’s most sophisticated field scanning hardware, Horizons can scan any facility for true as-built point cloud measuring. Then, expanding on Horizons’ knowledge of Horizonsineering software, we can process those files to deliver a finished Revit® or CAD file to our client for use beyond just the field survey. The unique marriage of point cloud scanning with Horizons’ real-world experience means we can create a point cloud as simple or complex as the customer needs.

                        </p>
                        <p>Unlike any other scanning services, our all-in-one solution gives us the power to site scan, then turn out a fully compatible BIM file with true parametric metadata value in the native BIM authoring platform.

                        </p>
