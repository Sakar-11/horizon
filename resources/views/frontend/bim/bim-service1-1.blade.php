                        </h3>
                        <p>The foundation Horizons’ services begin with our superior quality modeling expertise. We bring complete Autodesk® REVIT, Autodesk® Fabrication CADmep and Bentley BIM (AECOsim expertise) to the table for all disciplines: Architectural, Structural, Civil, Mechanical, Electrical, Plumbing, and Fire Protection. Our key strength is our customer-centric approach, allowing us to develop long-term business relationships with our clients.

                        </p>
                        <p>Building Information Modeling is our central focus in design and constructability analysis.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Our team consists of architects, engineers, trade specialists and other highly skilled professionals who can design BIMs from scratch or convert 2D drawings into 3D models with real construction experience.
                        </p>
                        <p>Horizons saves time and money by virtually assembling a building before it’s been constructed.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            According to required BIM output, we can create simple models with lower LOD (Level of development) that generate Clash Detection reports; further, more complex models can produce Quantity Take-Offs, or even LOD 400 Fabrication Models to extract shop drawings and spools, as well as data rich LOD 500 models for 6D Facility Management purposes.

                        </p>
                        <p>
