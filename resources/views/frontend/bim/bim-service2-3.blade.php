                        <p>Accurate quantification of building components is a constant necessity during the design and construction phases of any project. Horizons assists during the Procurement process by providing QTOs generated from the BIM.

                        <p>
                            Accurate comparative data, combined with optional studies and/or phasing, can be a powerful tool in maintaining and optimizing efficiencies. Horizons collaborates with our clients to maximize the value of a model toward these tasks.
