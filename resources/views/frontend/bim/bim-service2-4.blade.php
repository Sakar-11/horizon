                        <p>Complex site logistics and installation phasing are some of many potential applications for visualization. Graphic representations, created to understand time-based processes, helps foresee conflicts and study potential solutions. 4D adds the time factor of the construction schedule to the 3D model. We can directly link each activity of a Gantt chart (generated in project management software such as Primavera or Microsoft Project) to the BIM.

                        </p>
                        <p>These animated models represent the planned construction sequence set against time. The main purpose of a construction phasing simulation is to provide a tool that will help the construction team visualize logistical issues or inefficiencies. The simulation exposes details such as out-of-sequence work, scheduling conflicts between multiple trades, “what if” scenarios, and macro-level construction phasing strategies – all in order to achieve the optimization of the construction schedule.
