                        <p>Through years of experience, Horizons knows as construction nears completion, a drop in the level of attention to detail regarding documentation occurs. Owners often receive disconnected documents, specifications, and/or equipment manuals; additionally, they receive semi-accurate construction documents and electronic models to which the documents pertain. This information is then processed to various degrees of effectiveness and placed into a system used for Facility Management. Not surprisingly, many of these models are electronic versions of completely disjointed information. As a result, BIM fails to deliver as intended.

                        </p>
                        <p>Horizons has developed methods through which proper documentation is gathered, verified, and processed. This information is available to the user through a customized proprietary web-based environment, ensuring the owner has global accessibility. The Owner or Facility Manager will have full access to a simple yet powerful virtual building model containing relevant information to manage property, building systems, and components for the life of the facility.

                        </p>
